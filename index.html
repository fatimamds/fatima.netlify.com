<!--Its easy to style the page using Google Chrome's "Inspect" (what we get when we right-click the page), but its not the correct way.

To style an HTML page, we must first 
    * define a new individual classes in the body tags (as here we have defined "site-header", and "profile-pic"), 
    * and then edit these classes in a new CSS file, 
    * and link that CSS file to our HTML page under the head.

However, it is helpful to pick colors and decide how the page looks overall by doing the Chrome Inspect. We can simply code partially there and paste that code in our CSS file.-->
